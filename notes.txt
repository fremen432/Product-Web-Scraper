Puppeteer documentaion: (https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/v14.4.1/docs/api.md#pagescreenshotoptions) 

Applications Intentions:

    Build an application that helps a user find the best price/deal for any given product they search for.
    This app does this by searching the top 5 most popular e-commerce websites (amazon ebay, walmart, craigslist and target), finding the top 10 search results results from each website, then displaing the top 5 lowest prices for the user.

    This will involve using puppeteer to search all 5 websites.

    User inputs:

        Product Name: "String", *required
        Min Price: Number, (optional: defaults to 0)
        Max Price: Number, (optional:)
        Condition: (New or used) (optional: defaults to both (all search results))

    Results:

        top 10 results from each website:
            for each result:
