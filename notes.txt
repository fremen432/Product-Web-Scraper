Puppeteer documentaion: (https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/v14.4.1/docs/api.md#pagescreenshotoptions) 

Applications Intentions:

    Build an application that helps a user find the best price/deal for any given product they search for.
    This app does this by searching the top 5 most popular e-commerce websites (amazon ebay, walmart, craigslist and target), finding the top 10 search results results from each website, then displaing the top 5 lowest prices for the user.

    This will involve using puppeteer to search all 5 websites.

    User inputs:

        Product Name: "String", *required
        Min Price: Number, (optional: defaults to 0)
        Max Price: Number, (optional:)
        Condition: (New or used) (optional: defaults to both (all search results))

    Results:

        top 10 results from each website:
            for each result:
                Image of product
                Full Name
                Price
                Condition

Things I've learned doing this project:

    Writing Javascript into the browser DOM:
        A big one is, I learned that you can type in javascript into the browser console and it will run. That sounds really stupid to specify outloud, but I never put it together unitl this project. It comes in really useful when working with the DOM. So, you can just wright "document.querySelector('selector')" and it will return that element. I found it useful with writing "document.querySelectorAll('selector)" and had it return an object with all of the matches.

    Using the 'typeof' keyword before some element to understand the type of elements I'm working is really useful. 

    Understanding interfaces in TypeScript, and getting my feet wet with using types. Kind of annoying how, when testing code with nodeJS you have to first compile the .ts file into a .js file using tsc. Not sure if theres an easier way to quickly test TypeScript code asside from this method.

    Headless means that the browser will run in the background and it won't actually open a physicial tab on your browser when you run your puppeteer commands. 

    Jul 4 : 
        I'm starting to run into an issue of sites blocking my searches. Didn't anticipate runing into this problem. I might have to modify my application to utilize web scraping as well as search APIs.

        Walmart is blocking my search requests.

        I tried using the puppeteerExtra node module with the stealth mode plugin, but it didn't work.
